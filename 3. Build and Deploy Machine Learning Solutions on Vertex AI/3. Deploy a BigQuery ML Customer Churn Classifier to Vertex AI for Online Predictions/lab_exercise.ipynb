[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is Google Cloud's complimentary next generation, unified platform for machine learning development. By developing and deploying BQML machine learning solutions on Vertex AI, you can leverage a scalable online prediction service and MLOps tools for model retraining and monitoring to significantly enhance your development productivity, the ability to scale your workflow and decision making with your data, and accelerate time to value.\n",

See that blog post and accompanying tutorial for additional depth on this use case and BigQuery ML. In this lab, you will go one step further and focus on how Vertex AI extends BQML's capabilities through online prediction so you can incorporate both customer churn predictions into decision making UIs such as [Looker dashboards](https://looker.com/google-cloud) but also online predictions directly into customer applications to power targeted interventions such as targeted incentives."

For mobile game developers, improving user retention is critical to revenue stability and increasing profitability. In fact, [Bain & Company research](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers) found that 5% growth in retention rate can result in a 25-95% increase in profits. With lower costs to retain existing customers, the business objective for game developers is clear: reduce churn and improve customer loyalty to drive long-term profitability.\n",

[Vertex Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai) helps you understand your model's outputs for classification and regression tasks. Specifically, Vertex AI tells you how much each feature in the data contributed to your model's predicted result. You can then use this information to verify that the model is behaving as expected, identify and mitigate biases in your models, and get ideas for ways to improve your model and your training data."

    "In this lab, you used `user_psuedo_id` as a user identifier. As next steps, you can extend this code further by having your application return a `user_id` to Google Analytics so you can join your model's predictions with additional first-party data such as purchase history and marketing engagement data. This enables you to integrate batch predictions into Looker dashboards to help product teams prioritize user experience improvements and marketing teams create targeted user interventions such as reminder emails to improve retention. \n",
